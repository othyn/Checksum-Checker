# FileChecksum Checker
File checksum checker written in C# (Windows Form based), as a personal alternative to the CLI based FCIV, which did the job but it makes an excuse for a new project. :)

Currently it only accepts MD5 hashes, but I'm currently working on adding SHA1 support.

It was also my way of branching into C# and having a play, thus the heavy commenting and references as to make sure I thoroughly understand what I'm writing. By the end of the project, I had taken on board new concepts and had quite a bit of fun just adding functionality out of my own fruition. The side benefit of this project was providing a tool in which I will find personally useful.
