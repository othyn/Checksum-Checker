# FileChecksum Checker
File checksum checker written in C# (Windows Form based), as a personal alternative to the CLI based FCIV, which did the job but it makes an excuse for a new project. :)

It was also my way of branching into C# and having a play, thus the heavy commenting and references as to make sure I thoroughly understand what I'm writing. By the end of the project, I had taken on board new concepts and had quite a bit of fun just adding functionality out of my own fruition. The side benefit of this project was providing a tool in which I will find personally useful.

## Todo
- Drag and drop file functionality
- Find a more versitle/elegant solution other than switch statements, code refactoring time? Code refactoring time.
- Enable / Disable "Get Hash" and "Compare Hash" buttons dynamically on file loaded and hash calculated
- Add checkbox for "Get and Compare Hash" or just "Get Hash"
- Save user preference on default loading hash alorithm
- Add item queue / allow multiple items? - the application is already threaded, just might be a nice feature
- Add "export hash to text file" option?
- GUI updates - it's functional, just, but needs looking at
